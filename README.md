Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room has a game called Draw It or Lose It available as an Android app. They want to develop the game into a web-based game that would be available to a wider audience. This would require a large database of images that can be loaded quickly to multiple users at the same time. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

In this document, I am particularly proud of the recommendations section. I spent a lot of time looking into the various options and selecting the one I thought would work the best.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Working with the design document helped me to see exactly what needed to be coded, removing a lot of guesswork. This allowed me to code only what needed to be coded and nothing more, saving time.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would revise the development requirements section. I did not fully understand what was being asked, and so I did not do a good job explaining. Should I revise the document, I would seek to understand what was being asked before proceeding. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user's needs by considering what it was they wanted the program to do. Since this game needed to host a database of images that could be called upon at a moment's notice and distributed to multiple users at the same time, I had to take this information into account when designing the game. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing software so the application works as the user thinks it should.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approached designing software by planning the software first with a UML diagram, allowing me to see how the classes needed to be built and how they would interact with each other. Planning a large application first to the best of one's ability allows one to see how the different parts of the application work together, and eliminate unnecessary or duplicate code before the code is written, saving time and energy.
